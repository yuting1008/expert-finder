## Troubleshooting
1. If you encounter any errors after deploying the app, you can check the error log on Azure App Services. First, you need to enable the Azure web app log stream. 
    - Navigate to Web App **Monitoring** > **App Service Logs**.
    - Enable **Application logging (Filesystem)** and click **Save**. 
    - You will then be able to see the log of the web app in **log stream**. \

1. If custom app uploaded is disabled, you can either use [Microsoft 365 development account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program) or contact your tenant administrator to turn on the upload custom app permission for your organization. Below are the steps to enable permission as a Teams admin:
    - When the custom app upload is disabled, the following error is displayed: \

    -  Navigate to **Teams apps** > **Permission policies**.
    -  Click on **Global (Org-wide app default)**. \
